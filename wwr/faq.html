            Is this a good trip for kids?
            <ul>
                <li>Absolutely! However, children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is if their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Don’t worry! The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. You will also have a guide on the boat with you. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?
            <ul>
                <li>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
Everyone on our rafting trips must wear a coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins, explaining what you should do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</li>

            What is included for the trip?
            <ul>
                <li>We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent, cot, eating utensils, and camping chair.
We provide water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks, are provided as well.</li>            
            </ul>

         <li>
            What do I need to bring?
            <ul>
                <li>Be prepared for both hot & dry weather, and cold & wet weather. Bring a rain jacket and rain pants - no ponchos. Quick dry shirts and shorts are suggested. Besides your camping/rafting clothing, some strongly suggested items to bring are two piece swimsuits, wide brim hats, sunglasses with strap socks, quick dry boots, sandals or water shoes, water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, waterproof sunscreen, and lip balm. Optional items include: gloves, fleece jacket, towel, bandana,  camera equipment, a book, journal and pen, and a small pillow.

            How far in advance should I book my trip?
            <ul>
                <li>If you have specific dates in mind, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible, 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</li>
