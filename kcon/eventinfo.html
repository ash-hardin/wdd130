        <p class="tabtext">KCON began in 2012 as a small gathering in Los Angeles meant to bring fans closer to the world of Korean pop music
            and culture. It launched just as K-pop was starting to take off internationally, and the timing helped it grow
            quickly. What started with a single concert and a few panels soon expanded into a full festival experience, mixing 
            performances with Korean food, beauty, fashion, and drama-focused events. It became a fun way for fans to experience
            the wider Hallyu wave in one place. As interest in K-pop spread, KCON grew right along with it, popping up in cities
            like New York, Tokyo, and Paris. Each stop added its own mix of meet-and-greets, workshops, and fan-driven events,
            giving people a chance to connect with artists and each other. Over the years, KCON has turned into a place where
            fans can celebrate the music they love while learning more about the culture behind it.</p>
